# A dockerized monorepo

The intent of this repo is to be a structure for a fullstack monorepo with an easy developer experience (docker containers with hot reloading and a one start command that works for everyone)

#### frontend

React + Vite + TypeScript

#### backend

NodeJS (esm) + ExpressJS

### Quickstart

1. clone repo
2. cd to root directory
3. run `sh nuke-docker.sh` to make sure your docker is properly cleaned out
4. run `sh start-docker.sh` to startup everything
